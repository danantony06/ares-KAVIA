Instructions:
1. If your project uses Alembic, move this script into your migrations/versions/ folder.
2. Update `down_revision` to the current most recent revision if you use Alembic; set `down_revision` appropriately.
3. Run `alembic upgrade head` to apply.
4. If Alembic is not used, you can instead run the following SQL:
    ALTER TABLE exercise_log ADD COLUMN weight FLOAT;
    ALTER TABLE exercise_log ADD COLUMN reps INTEGER;
5. No destructive operationsâ€”existing data will be preserved. If you need to backfill historic data for these columns, add Python code in your migration or use SQL UPDATE statements.
