## About

While there are many excellent workout trackers available, I always found myself going back to my good old notes after trying them out for a while. I felt overwhelmed by their complexity and craved a simple way to track my weights and machine adjustments at a glance. That's why I created Ares!

Ares is a minimalist workout tracker built with Flask, Python, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, and pure CSS. It allows users to create workouts with multiple exercises and store weights and details for each one. With Ares, you can quickly switch between workouts and easily make edits. It was designed to be a practical solution for those who want to track their progress while maintaining efficiency.
